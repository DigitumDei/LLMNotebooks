I'll try and stick it nicely for you. They definitely sound a little bit angrier than they were last time. They've got a little bit more boomer in them. I'm actually going to leave this outside one because this is the one I'm looking down. There's wax but nothing on it. So I'm going to leave it because remember they're properlized.

Maybe we need to consider putting a frame of brood. A brood frame and maybe some honey. I think so. We find a frame with honey and brood in one of the other ones. Have we got some spare frames? Have we got some spare frames in here? Aren't those just super frames? No, no. These are the two big ones on top. And I think those got frozen. But they're full of lots of pollen on that little guy there. Very empty. This hive's not looking happy at all. It's active, but it just seems to be struggling to do enough brood. I don't know if it's... Okay, let's see you guys on this side. So what's happening on this side? Not a lot. Lots of activity, just not much happening.

But I mean it's up to you. But like lift this lid. Let me lift it. I cannot see varroa mites on any of these guys now. So I feel like that's under control. There's definitely some dead bees.

Giving you some salt, I'm not sure if you want salt. Okay, frame eight, capped brood, lots of larvae, some eggs, tiny bit of honey. Looks good. Would have expected a bit more honey. I think they're, it seems like they've ramped up the brood a lot since we put the super on so have they gearing up for more. Okay, here we go. Some capped honey, some nectar, tiny bit of pollen.

I think it looks like they're getting ready to start expanding into the super even though there's a lot of space or a lot of empty comb in the bottom one. There's a ton of brood. So I'm just pushing. We need to get that going again. Yeah, I think we do some grass into it. Nice smoke but it's gone now. So these guys are getting used to it now. So these are the sticks. So these are the sticks.

Little bit of cross combing. Okay, you're taking mental notes in case none of these are of our... Okay, lots of nectar in frame five. Capped honey on both sides, maybe about 30%. Yeah. Great frame. Deep idea in here. The nectar. The nectar, yeah. Drinking. Okay, what are we? Sixth frame. Six lots of nectar. About 20% capped honey. That was another box we put going so out of the new comb.

Okay, frame 10, pretty empty, little bit of pollen, little bit of nectar. Oh, and a little bit of capped honey, so maybe 10%. They're still filling up the frames.
